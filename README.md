# Ectoplasm
 A tracker for Balatro all unlocks speedrunning

# Setup
 Download the latest release and unzip it, launch the Ectoplasm.exe, Windows might stop this, if it does click more info and run anyways.
 Once the tool has been launched it might ask for permission to access your network, this is as a consequence of how the decompiler works, however allowing access is not necessary.
 With the tool now open click "Settings" in the bottom left corner, go to save and make sure the Balatro folder location is correct (note that this is not the folder where the local files are stored, it will usually be located at "C://Users/USERPROFILE/AppData/Roaming/Balatro") and change the Save file to whichever save you are playing on.

 # Using the overlay
  First you will want to enable the overlay in the settings then in OBS add a new Window Capture setting it to the overlay window and turning Window Match Priority to "Window title must match". Next right click the overlay capture, select   "filters" and add a colorkey with the Key Color Type set to "Green" and the Similarity set to whatever value fits.
